Welcome to Bert's Page!

This is the homework for 02-CSS/Boostrap.

I used one master css file for all three .html files to ensure continuity and redundancy in media query, and any individual tweaking I did through Bootstrap where possible.
I really liked the Bootstrap Popper dependant collapsable navbar, which I used rather than making a bootstrap grid, hence the jQuery script call at the end of the pages.
While the form is there on the contact page, I don't utilize the data, it is honestly a dead page, but I want to think it's a practice in form placement and css/bootstrap.
The portfolio page are all invented projects, but the links do work.  
When going to NNPS, I had a grizzled old Senior Chief who used to go to Club Med and stay in the Turqoise Bungalows, which he pronounced "TUR-QUA" and left me subconsciously preferring cyan and turquoise as colors, hence the color choice.
Hope this meets the requirements!
